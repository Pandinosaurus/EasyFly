# EasyFly
#### (Another drone Firmware)

![EasyFly micro-hexa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanseidel/EasyFly/master/assets/drone.jpg)

This is a simple Drone Firmware developed in a Livecoding. It should work
fine for any normal drone that doesn't use brushless motors or changes
it form during flight.

Notice: this does no more than Flying.

## Hardware

This should work just fine with any 8Mhz Atmega328 or any arduino
bootloader.

(Todo: Share Electronics needed)

## Drone Layout

We have implemented a really generic drone-layout setup, you will
find it in `Drone.cpp`.

# Configs

Configs are in `_config.h`
